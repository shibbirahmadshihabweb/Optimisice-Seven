                            Look, we’re all about living in the moment. But if
                            you’re a brand hosting an influencer event or
                            activation, these IRL moments deserve to live
                            forever as scroll-stopping user-generated
                            content. Whether it’s a store opening, product
                            launch, fashion show, VIP sit-down dinner, or just a
                            really good excuse to pour champagne – there’s one

                            Just ask any bride or groom ever. Quite
                            serendipitously, we’ve got a handful of brides (in

                                By Thursday? We had a handpicked guest list of
                                micro-influencers and mid-tier creators
                                (specifically real brides-to-be) locked in and
                                ready to step into the showroom, slip into
                                gowns, and whisper – with tears in their eyes –
                                “this could be the one…” <br />
                                Our mission was two-fold.

                                    We sourced talent that matched Raffaele

                                    Every name on our list was backed by data –

                                    Your move next, which is mainly just

                                    From there, we’ll handle creator outreach,
                                    arrange all comms and confirm RSVPs, so all
                                    you have to think about is logistics on the

                                    (...unless you’d like us to look after that
                                    too, then we’ve got even more to chat
                                    about)<br />

                                    Get people talking. If you've ever run an
                                    influencer event or brand activation, you’ll
                                    know the pain.  People show up, snap a few
                                    stories, maybe tag you once. But by the next
                                    day? It’s like it never happened. Instagram
                                    stories disappear within 24 hours, and so
                                    does all that potential reach, audience
                                    engagement, and return on investment. So, we
                                    made sure this wasn’t just another
                                    influencer event invite. Raffaele Ciuca
                                    opted into our Posted Content
                                    Guarantee add-on, meaning every guest was
                                    contractually locked in to deliver lasting,
                                    in-feed user-generated content / UGC. No
                                    flakiness. No ghosting. No “oops, sorry I
                                    forgot to post!”

                                    It’s as if the “R” in RSVP now stands for
                                    “Results” – because we’re talking stunning
                                    Instagram Reels, TikToks, and carousel
                                    photos that lived long past the thrills of
                                    the night. Especially given the fact that
                                    Raffaele Ciuca received all raw footage to
                                    repurpose organically, and in future
                                    marketing (incl. paid ads!) Content is
                                    currency, after all.

                                Word on the street is that one of our
                                brides-to-be, Adelle, actually found the dress.
                                We can’t confirm just yet (*superstition says
                                you’re not meant to know for certain until the
                                aisle), but if her TikTok is anything to go by…
                                It’s giving “this is the one.”

                                See it for yourself here: @adellepetros

                                Adelle’s genuine excitement practically radiated
                                through the TikTok, and to say she was glowing
                                is an understatement.“I can’t tell you the
                                attention to detail that (the staff) had. They
                                fluffed about the dress to the point I was like:
                                How can I get one of these staff members to be
                                present at MY wedding, on the day, to pro-fluff
                                me?” So funny. So real. So obviously authentic.

                                Audiences often know when a content creator is
                                faking their review about things (be it
                                products, services, or events) – but in the case
                                of Adelle, they knew this was unfiltered and
                                perfectly genuine.

                                that wedding dress shopping? Stressful.
                                Overwhelming. A lot.<br />

                                So, when a video (like Jen’s TikTok) opens with
                                “I seriously underestimated how much fun it
                                would be to be playing dress-up when it comes to
                                bridal shopping” as its hook, the entire
                                experience transforms into something fun.
                                Something aspirational and worth a try even –
                                especially when done with the experts at
                                Raffaele Ciuca Bridal.<br />

                                Both Jen and Adelle might’ve been at the same
                                event, but we’re now seeing it through a
                                different perspective. One that delves into the
                                most couture and extravagant designer options
                                because why TF not? It’s Jen’s big day! Her
                                comment section loved it as well: “That basque
                                waist gown is so beautiful!” – and our goal of
                                making user-generated content that gets people
                                talking? Achieved.
